# Solve the "FizzBuzz" problem in Golang

In the classic version, we should issue ```Fizz``` if the number is divisible by 3, ```Buzz``` if it is divided by 5, and ```FizzBuzz``` when it is divisible by both 3 and 5. But if we want to check for another pair? Let's say not 3 and 5, but 2 and 7... You will see the solution to this problem in my code. This is my first Golang project.
## Examples

```Go
fizzBuzz(1, 15, 3, 5) == "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz"
fizzBuzz(15, 30, 2, 7) == "15 Fizz 17 Fizz 19 Fizz Buzz Fizz 23 Fizz 25 Fizz 27 FizzBuzz 29 Fizz"
fizzBuzz(10, 20, 2, 4) == "Fizz 11 FizzBuzz 13 Fizz 15 FizzBuzz 17 Fizz 19 FizzBuzz"
```
